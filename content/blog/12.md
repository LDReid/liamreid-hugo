Little more than a year later and I'm back editing my website... I have been occupied at Buckeye Marine for almost 2 years as a Marketing Coordinator. Been really building up my skills with social media, newsletters, graphics, and ads (primarily Facebook Ads...)

Felt inspired to add more content to my personal site since I am feeling more open to future opportunities outside the dealership.

The portfolio page will bee updated with highlights of my work during my time at Buckeye.
