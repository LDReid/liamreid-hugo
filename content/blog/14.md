I have officially joined the Titus One team working as an independent contractor in a Marketing Specialist role. I will absolutely be learning a lot of new skills, and stepping out of my comfort zone a lil bit. I have worked with Titus One for a couple years now on the Buckeye Marine account, and now they are kind enough to give me a shot in their agency. (For a role I'm slightly under qualified for!) I'll be independent so I'm responsible for doing my own billing, tracking hours, taxes and all that freelancer type of stuff. Buckeye Marine is not entirely out of the picture though. Because of the flexible nature of the contrator role, I will most likely be working with Buckeye project by project billing them the same way I am for Titus. I do value my freedom, and taking charge of my calendar and using my time wisely can net me a lot of quality time to continue to develop my apps. We must earn many dollars.
