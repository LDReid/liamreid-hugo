A short while ago I applied for a a role as a social media coordinator for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry for the Fishing and Wildlife sector. It genuinely sounds like the perfect job for me to progress into a higher paying position in the marketing world.

In the next weeks to come I will know if they showed intrest in my application. Just visualizing it happening and imagining my interview... Ministry, call me.
